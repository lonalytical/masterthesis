## Data generation
A simulation study was conducted to compare the methods of missing data handling. (erklären, was eine Simulationsstudie ist)

Data was generated from a parametric model with known parameters.

## Data-generating model

The data-generating model was a two-level random intercept model:
$$
Y_{ij}\ =\gamma_{10}\ (X_{ij}\ -\ {\bar{X.}}_{j})\ +\gamma_{01}\ {\bar{X.}}_j\ +\ \gamma_{02}\ W_j\ +\ u_{0j}\ +\ e_{ij}\ 
$$ {#eq-dgm}
The random effects are normally distributed with
$u_{0j}\sim\ N\left(0,\ \psi^2\right)$ and $e_{ij}\sim\ N(0,\ \sigma^2)$
and independent of each other.<br>
$Y_{ij}$, $X_{ij}$ and $W_{j}$ are created as z-standardized variables, which means that they have a mean of zero and a variance of 1.<br>

## Missing data generation

## Factors and simulation conditions
### Constants
### Level-2 sample size
As the small-sample performance of the methods is of interest, three different group sizes are used:
- N2 = 15
- N2 = 30
- N2 = 60
These sizes are chosen to reflect McNeish´s [-@mcneishSmallSampleMethods2017] summary that group sizes below 25 almost certainly face issues and below 50 there is a susceptibility to small sample biases. These sample sizes should therefore cover problematic, likely problematic and not problematic magnitudes.
### Effect size of the group-level effect {\gamma01}
The effect size of the group-level effect of X is varied between 0.0 and 0.30. This is to investigate the performance both with a null effect of the parameter of interest as well as a substantive effect.

### ICC of X and residual Y
### Missing data mechanism
Missing data mechanism is set to either MCAR or MAR. For MAR, the strength of relationship between W and missing of X is set to 0.4, which corresponds to 0.4^2 % 100% explanation of variance in missingness through W.
