## Data generation
A simulation study was conducted to compare the methods of missing data handling. (erklären, was eine Simulationsstudie ist)

Data was generated from a parametric model with known parameters.

## Data-generating model

The data-generating model was a two-level random intercept model:

$$
Y_ij =
$$ {#eq-dgm}

First, 

## Missing data generation

## Factors and simulation conditions
### Constants
### Level-2 sample size
As the small-sample performance of the methods is of interest, three different group sizes are used:
- N2 = 15
- N2 = 30
- N2 = 60
These sizes are chosen to reflect McNeish´s (2017) summary, that group sizes below 25 almost certainly face issues and below 50 there is a susceptibility to small sample biases. These ranges should therefore cover problematic, likely problematic and not problematic level-2 sample sizes.
### Effect size of the group-level effect {\gamma01}
The effect size of the group-level effect of X is varied between 0.0 and 0.30. This is to investigate the performance both with a null effect of the parameter of interest as well as a substantive effect.

### ICC of X and residual Y
### Missing data mechanism
Missing data mechanism is set to either MCAR or MAR. For MAR, the strength of relationship between W and missing of X is set to 0.4, which corresponds to 0.4^2 % 100% explanation of variance in missingness through W.
